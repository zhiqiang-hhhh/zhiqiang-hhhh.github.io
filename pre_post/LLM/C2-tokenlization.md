Okey before we start to plug text into neural networks, we will have to go decide how we goning to  represent this text and how we gonna to feed it. Now the way our technoly works for these neural networks is that the expect a one-dimensional sequence of symbols and they want a finite set of symbols    that are possible. And so we have to decide what are the symbols, and we have to decide how to represent our data as an one-dimensional sequence of those symbols. So right now what we have is a one-dimensional sequence of text it goes ehre and ot comes here. so this si one-dimensional sequenct even though my model train of course it laid out in a two-dimensional way but it gose from left to right and top to bottom right? so it is a one-dimensional sequence of text, now this being computer itself. There is a underlying represention here so if i do what is called utf-8 encode to these text and then i can get the raw bits that correspond to this text in the computer. that looks like this.
